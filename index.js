          Iâ€™m an early stage investor at Accel. I spend most of my time on AI & cybersecurity,
          and opportunistically on deeptech & consumer platforms.

          Previously, I was an operator at Mosaic Wellness (consumer health). I joined them
          at ~$10M topline and helped scale to ~$50M by setting up their telehealth BU from scratch.
